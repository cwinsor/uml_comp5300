The definitions of \"positive\" and \"negative\" generally depend on the domain of your task. For example \"long-lasting smell\" may carry positive sentiment in the context of perfume but might be negative in the context of a cleaning solution. Sentiment analysis systems could be used by the companies who want to understand how positive was the social media reaction to their latest announcement or in the user feedback forms to address the negative feedback quickly.\n","\n","In this homework, we will be predicting the sentiment of movie reviews using IMDB dataset.

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn't have much of a plot.\n"]}],"source":["# Get the first element of the train_set\n","# YOUR CODE HERE\n","row = train_set[0]\n","print(\"first row label: \", row['label'])\n","print(\"first row text:  \", row['text'])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"4ef6cfd1-96ba-4400-9d6e-0a6d4da69b97","metadata":{"id":"4ef6cfd1-96ba-4400-9d6e-0a6d4da69b97","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"f915e370-d6a3-4c35-ee4b-3b78bf8bec90"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["last row label:  1\n","last row text:   The story centers around Barry McKenzie who must go to England if he wishes to claim his inheritance.

Which model is actually worse? Can you improve any of these predictors with some simple post-processing of the results (the binary prediction)?\n","\n","**A:** YOUR ANSWER\n","The predictor with 0% accuracy is actually a perfect predictor, it's just got the target labels swapped.\n","So to answer the second question - post-processing the 0% predictor by swapping the prediction labels would result in 100% accuracy. For the 50% predictor you cannot improve the results by just post-processing.\n","\n","**Q3:** Should the accuracy 99% be considered \"good\" for any binary classification dataset?\n","\n","**A:** YOUR ANSWER\n","\"Good\" depends on the context.  99% is not satisfactory for stoplight prediction but fine for ad placement. The requirements of the system define what is 'good'.\n","\n","**Q4:** Imagine that you have a binary classification dataset that has 99.9% of one class and 0.1% of the other. What is the best possible accuracy for a predictor that completely ignores the text?\n","\n","**A:** YOUR ANSWER\n","Always predicting the \"heavy\" class will average 99.9% accuracy here.\n","\n","**Q5:** Is it a good idea to use accuracy as the main metric in the example above? Are there any other metrics that would work better in this situation?\n","\n","**A:** YOUR ANSWER\n","Accuracy is not a good measure when classes are unbalanced.\n","Alternatives include:\n","* Sensitivity = TruePositive / (TruePositive + FalseNegative)\n","* Specificity = TrueNegative / (FalsePositive + TrueNegative)\n","* G-Mean = sqrt(Sensitivity * Specificity)\n","* Precision = TruePositive / (TruePositive + FalsePositive)\n","* Recall = TruePositive / (TruePositive + FalseNegative)\n","* F-Measure = (2 * Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n","* Fbeta-Measure = ((1 + beta^2) * Precision * Recall) / (beta^2 * Precision + Recall)\n","\n","(reference https://machinelearningmastery.com/tour-of-evaluation-metrics-for-imbalanced-classification/)\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"714e9508-820e-449b-8a42-499ee9a742c5","metadata":{"id":"714e9508-820e-449b-8a42-499ee9a742c5"},"source":["## Text vectorization\n","\n","In the class, we have talked about possibly the simplest way to represent text to a computer: bag-of-words (BoW) approach.

Now, let's look into how it works.\n","\n","Scikit-learn (`sklearn`) is a popular framework for *Classical ML* and it includes many machine learning models including nearest-neighbors, trees, SVMs, and linear models.\n","Also, it includes different pre-processing techniques.

For example, if your text is \"can a canner can a can\", it could be described with a vector [3, 2, 1] where 3 is the count of the word \"can\", 2 -- \"a\", and 1 -- \"canner\". In order for the vectors to be meaningful, the vectorizer needs to have a defined vocabulary of words it accounts for and the defined order of the words in the vocabulary so that the index 0 would always correspond to a word \"can\" in any text.\n","\n","Let's create a `CountVectorizer` object."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"feb4dde5-ace4-4701-b01f-51bf5521ed7c","metadata":{"id":"feb4dde5-ace4-4701-b01f-51bf5521ed7c","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"outputId":"c149430f-2a90-4e21-aeda-edb5f24fd8c2"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["CountVectorizer()"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}],"source":["from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n","\n","count_vectorizer = CountVectorizer()\n","count_vectorizer"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b2db3aca-c300-4cf9-b35e-c13c14af5a2f","metadata":{"id":"b2db3aca-c300-4cf9-b35e-c13c14af5a2f"},"source":["It is not very useful right now.
