So (my opinion) keep the uppercase and all punctuation. Even with this the vocabulary will be small (about 200) because there's no hashtags or URLs.\n","\n","2) No stemming, lemmitization, stop-word required.\n","\n","3) \"n-gram\" not required as the transformer is already looking at sequences.\n","\n","4) Another option that would be interesting is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003). LDA is a technique used to compare objects that are comprised of a variable number of components. LDA is a general technique and can be applied in many domains. LDA is the extension of the Beta distribution to multinominal variable. It assumes components in an object are drawn from a multinominal distribution with each document sampled from the same vocabulary but with different proportions.\n","As applied to documents the objective is to allow comparing documents to one-another and to document sets. It is a 3-level probabilistic model consisting of words, documents and topics. An experiment is the drawing of a document, and the random variables are first a collection of one or more topics, and second a topic is comprised of (a distribution over) a set of words that is the vocabulary. The model differs from the earlier unigram, mixture of unigrams and pLSI/aspect models because it expresses a document as one or more topics, where the earlier models express a document directly as terms without a per-document topic distribution.\n","\n","5) Encoding is the process of transforming the sequence of tokens into sequences of numbers. This can be a simple dictionary lookup or can be more sophisticated. For example byte-pair encoding (Sennrich) works by iteratively combining recurring adjacent pairs into a single code. The result is that common token-pairs are represented as a single code and rare words are a sequence of sub-word codes. In choosing an encoding scheme the tradeoff is between codebook size vs sequence length - a larger codebook correlates to shorter encoded sequences and vice-versa.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tIO5dOt7i3oF"},"source":["# Step 2: preparing the data for the model\n","\n","## Coding task 3.2\n","Similar to previous homeworks, where we made a vocabualry of words, we will make a vocabulary of characters.\n","\n","1.
