    "\n",
    "Think about how you can pre-process the data (in terms of modifying the text). Provde three ideas and explain why you think they are useful or not. Think about the size of the data, tokenization method (we will use character-level language model), your computational resources, and what kind of text you want to generate. Make this answer as extensive as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Your answer:***\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The conversational format (\"SPEAKER:\\n\") is significant and should be preserved. So (my opinion) keep the uppercase and all punctuation. Even with this the vocabulary will be small (about 200) because there's no hashtags or URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) No stemming, lemmitization, stop-word required.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) \"n-gram\" not required as the transformer is already looking at sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Another option that would be interesting is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003). LDA is a technique used to compare objects that are comprised of a variable number of components. LDA is a general technique and can be applied in many domains. LDA is the extension of the Beta distribution to multinominal variable. It assumes components in an object are drawn from a multinominal distribution with each document sampled from the same vocabulary but with different proportions.\n",
    "As applied to documents the objective is to allow comparing documents to one-another and to document sets. It is a 3-level probabilistic model consisting of words, documents and topics. An experiment is the drawing of a document, and the random variables are first a collection of one or more topics, and second a topic is comprised of (a distribution over) a set of words that is the vocabulary. The model differs from the earlier unigram, mixture of unigrams and pLSI/aspect models because it expresses a document as one or more topics, where the earlier models express a document directly as terms without a per-document topic distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Encoding is the process of transforming the sequence of tokens into sequences of numbers. This can be a simple dictionary lookup or can be more sophisticated. For example byte-pair encoding (Sennrich) works by iteratively combining recurring adjacent pairs into a single code. The result is that common token-pairs are represented as a single code and rare words are a sequence of sub-word codes. In choosing an encoding scheme the tradeoff is between codebook size vs sequence length - a larger codebook correlates to shorter encoded sequences and vice-versa.\n"

    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, `F.cross_entropy` expects the logits to be of shape `(batch_size, num_classes)` and the targets to be of shape `(batch_size,)` containing the class indices. In our case, the logits tensor has the shape `(batch_size, seq_len, num_classes)` and the targets are of shape `(batch_size, seq_len)`. We need to reshape the input and the targets to make them compatible with `F.cross_entropy`. You can do it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bs, seq_len, num_classes = logits.shape\n",

    "During evlauation you just need to log the perplexity, the loss, and accuracy. Perplexity is just `exp(loss)`.\n",
    "Accuracy is not the most standard metric for language models, but it is very intererpretable and easy to compute. Don't expect it to be high, though.\n",
    "Be mindful how frequenly you evaluate your model. You don't want to evaluate it too often, because it will slow down your training loop.\n",
